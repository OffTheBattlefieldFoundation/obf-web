          The Off the Battlefield Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
          organization dedicated to rebuilding and healing communities affected
          by conflict. Through innovative programs, we foster resilience,
          promote collaboration, and support sustainable development in regions
          striving for recovery. Our first project is called the Ukraine
          Rebuilding Initiative (URI), which is housed in our two main
          university chapters at the University of Florida (UF) and the
          University of Central Florida (UCF).
